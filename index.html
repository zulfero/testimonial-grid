          i recieved a job offfer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company i joinrd. I honestly feel i
          got every penny's worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        <h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recomended!</h1>

        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from pro"fessionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirsi find really refreshing who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainley helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! </p>
